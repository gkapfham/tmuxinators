This repository contains a BibTeX file for all of the research papers, presentations, volumes edited, supervised theses,
and supervised presentations of me, [Gregory M. Kapfhammer](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham). You are free to
use any of the entries in this file if you are interested in citing one of these research deliverables in a LaTeX
document. This repository is used in [gkapfham/curriculum-vitae](https://github.com/gkapfham/curriculum-vitae) to
automatically create several sections of my curriculum vitae.

#### Installation Instructions

You can type the following command if you want to clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gkapfham/research-bibliography.git
```

Now, you can type `cd research-bibliography` and use the BibTeX file in your own LaTeX project.  Alternatively, a
document that cites all of the entries in this bibliography can be compiled on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS workstation using
`pdflatex` and `biber`; you may also compile to a PDF file using a wide variety of other tools, such as `latexmk`. You
can type the following commands to create the summary document.
