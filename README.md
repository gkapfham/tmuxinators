# tmuxinators

This repository contains the Tmuxinator configuration files used to setup Tmux sessions for all of the research papers,
presentations, and research projects of [Gregory M. Kapfhammer](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham). If you
would learn more about Tmuxinator, then please visit the [Tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) site. Essentially,
Tmuxinator allows you to write configuration files that support the quick and easy setup of a Tmux session. If you are new
to Tmux and the joys of using a "terminal multiplexor", then please visit the [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) site
and do some reading of the many online articles about this tool. Please note that all of the Tmuxinators in this
repository are hard-coded to work for my development environment. But, even though they are heavily customized, my hope
is that they will give examples of different facets of Tmuxinator (e.g., the layout specification strings).

#### Installation Instructions

You can type the following command if you want to clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gkapfham/tmuxinators.git
```

Now, you can type `cd tmuxinators` and start to browse the Tmuxinator configuration files that are now available. I
suggest that you make symbolic links from the '.tmuxinator' directory to this repository if you want to create and use
these configuration files in a disciplined fashion.
