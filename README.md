# tmuxinators

This repository contains the Tmuxinator configuration files used to setup Tmux sessions for all of the research papers,
presentations, and software development projects of [Gregory M. Kapfhammer](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham).
If you would learn more about Tmuxinator, then please visit the [Tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator)
site.  Essentially, Tmuxinator allows you to write configuration files that support the quick and repeatable setup of a
well-structured Tmux session. If you are new to Tmux and the joys of using a "terminal multiplexor", then please visit
the [Tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) site and do some reading of the many online articles about this tool. Please
note that all of the Tmuxinators in this repository are "hard-coded" to work for my development environment and
projects.  But, even though they are heavily customized, my hope is that they will give examples of different facets of
Tmuxinator (e.g., the layout specification strings).

## Installation Instructions

You can type the following command if you want to clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gkapfham/tmuxinators.git
```

Now, you can type `cd tmuxinators` and start to browse the Tmuxinator configuration files that are available. I
suggest that you make symbolic links from the `.tmuxinator` directory to this repository if you want to create and use
these configuration files in a disciplined fashion.

## Problems or Praise?

If you have any problems with downloading or understanding these Tmuxinator configuration files, then please create an
issue associated with this Git repository using the "Issues" link at the top of this site. As the sole contributor to
the `tmuxinator` repository, I will do everything possible to resolve your issue and ensure that all of the Tmuxinator
configurations are clear and, potentially, best suited to working in your development environment.  Remember, this
repository is being made publicly available so as to provide examples of how to write Tmuxinator configurations. If you
find that these files help you in preparing your own Tmuxinator configurations, then I also encourage you to "star" and
"watch" this project!
